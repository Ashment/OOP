                   Most programs need input to on the basis of which they
                   perform results.The input to be read has to be placed
                   somewhere in the computer's memory to be read by the
                   program and is called an <i>object</i>.

                <p>
                    A named object is called a variable and every object 
                    has a type that specifies the kind of information placed 
                    in that object.

                To access the object we need a name. A named object
                is called a variable and should have a specific
                type.
                </p>
                <p>
                The type determines the type of operation that can 
                be done on the variable.
                A statement that defines a variable is called a 
                definition and is generally used to provide an 
                initial value.</br>
                </p>
                <p>
                A compiler checks for the type of variable and 
                makes sure that you use a variable according to it's type.</br>

                <p>
                The input operation is sensitive to the type,it reads 
                depending on the type of input.</br>
                if you provided "CS 2953" as an input "CS" will be read 
                in a variable of type string and 2953 by variable of type
                int.Reading of string is terminated by whitespace which is 
                either space, tab or new line.</br>
                cin would keep reading the input charachters until a 
                new line is entered.After pressing enter, next line of
                code will be executed</br>
                </p>
                <p>
                If in the above string we provided "2953 CS", 2953 would
                be read by the string, because 2953 is a sequence of 
                character and age would be printed as 0.</br> 
                </p>
                <p>
                As you didn't provide any value to the int variable 
                and as there is a type mismatch in the above input, 
                the output that would be printed is "2953 0".</br>
                Hence, variable should be initialized so as to 
                avoid unpredictable values of data.

                <p>
                A string read by &gt; &gt; is by default terminated 
                by a whitespace. If we want to read more than one 
                word, we would read something like in below example.

                The compiler knows the operations that can be applied 
                to each variables and can prevent many mistakes.
                There are some usual arithmetic operations like </br>
                &plus; </br>
                &minus; </br>
                &divide; </br>

                <p>
                There are some operations on String that can be performed
                &plus; is used to concatenate the string.
                &equals; &equals; is used to compare strings.

                We start word counter at 0. Each time we see a word, we
                increment the counter and we print the word which is repeated
                and the position at which it occured.

                A name for a variable is used to make it easier to refer them
                from somewhere else in the program. A name in C++ refers with 
                a letter and can contain only letters, digits and
                underscore.A variable name cannot start with a
                number.</br></br>
                Here are some invalid variable names:</br> 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        #name       // not a valid character
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        var$name    // underscore is not allowed in a variable name
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        spice jet   // space is not allowed 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2x         // variable name cannot start with a number
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                </br></br>Variable names shouldn't be a reserved word. As compiler will
                generate error for such assignments.
                Although underscore is allowed as a variable name and you can
                start a variable with underscore, it is better to avoid such
                names because C++ has reserved some variable names such as
                _foo.The compiler has some words reserved for machine and
                system implementation which start with underscore.</br> 
                Variable names are case sensitive, foo and Foo hold a different
                meaning.You should avoid case sensitive variable names like
                IF or If, which is a case variation of a reserved word.
                Compiler would not throw an error in such cases, but a
                programmer might get confused with such assignments.

                    <li>
                    There are few keywords that are reserved by C++ like
                if, string, while, cout, cin which should not be used as
                variable.</br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                We should not use long variable names as they are hard to type,
                too long and not required. </br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                General practice for variable names is either to use
                underscores between names or to use camelCase like
                <i>spice_jet</i> or <i>spiceJet</i>. </br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                You should avoid using variable names with all uppercase, it is
                a bad practie.</br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                Initial letter as upperCase is used when defineing types like
                Employee.</br>

                Informally, we can think of an object as a box, into which we
                can put data of certain type. int a = 7 means a is of type int
                and it can old integer values.

                As we can see from above image, the string representation is a
                bit complex. It also holds the length of string. The memory
                required to store a data depends on the type of data.
                A bit is a unit of memory in a computer. A byte is represented
                by 8 bits. char requires 1 byte to store a data. int requires 
                4 bytes.</br></br>

                </br>Each type of data is stored as bits in a computer memory,i.e.
                an int 120 and char 'x' are both stored as bits,
                hence it is necessary to specify the type of data to exactly
                understand the value of data stored.</br>

                A program is type safe when operations on objects are done
                according to the type of object. We can do certain operations
                which are type unsafe and C++ compilers unfortunately allows
                that. For example, one should not use a variable which is
                uninitialized as it might give some unexpected output when
                used. This operation is type unsafe and C++ compiler doesn't
                catch it.</br>
                Ideally a programmer should use operations that are checked by
                compiler for static type safety, but this causes a lot of
                restrictions while programmimg. With C++, a programmer should
                be careful while coding and should avoid such type unsafe
                operations.

                There are certain conversions between the types which can be
                done without compromising the type safety.
                For example an int can be converted to a double, or a char or
                string can be converted to an int.Following are the conversions
                which are safe. </br>
                bool to char </br>
                bool to int </br>
                bool to double </br>
                char to  int </br>
                char to double </br>
                int to double </br>
                For a really large int we suffer lossy conversions
