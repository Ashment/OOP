What is the difference between a source file and an object file?#The source file is in Python and the object file is in C++.#The source file tells you where to look  on the Internet for good material and the object file complains.#^The source file is text in your programming language and the object file is binary.
What does an .h suffix at the end of a file signify in C++?#It is a heavy file that will take up lots of hard disk space.#It is a hard-coded file with lots of constants.#It is a healthy file that it would be good to incorporate into your program.#^It is a header file containing various definitions.
