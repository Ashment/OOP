Name the four parts of a function.#^return type, name, parameter list, function body#main, include, link, compile#cout, std_lib, class, comment
What does the linker do for your program?#Turns your C++ code into an object file.#Pulls in all of your include files.#^Joins separate object files and libraries into a single executable.#Handles pre-processing directives.
What is the difference between a source file and an object file?#The source file is in Python and the object file is in C++.#The source file tells you where to look  on the Internet for good material and the object file complains.#^The source file is text in your programming language and the object file is binary.
