The four major types of errors are...#header errors, variable errors, function errors and class errors#^compile-time, link-time, run-time, and logical#object errors, inheritance errors, template errors and polymorphism errors
A linker error would occur when...#^A function used in your source code can't be found in any linked file or library.#A variable should be linked by assignment to another variable but it is not.#A link between one class and another is missing.
An example of a run-time error is when...#you send the wrong type of argument to a function.#you meant to add tax to the sales price but you subtracted it instead.#^your program tries to divide by zero.#you forget the semi-colon at the end of a line of code.
An example of a logic error is when...y#you send the wrong type of argument to a function.#^you meant to add tax to the sales price but you subtracted it instead.#your program tries to divide by zero.#you forget the semi-colon at the end of a line of code.
One reason why throwing an exception is better than returning an error value is...#^the exception cannot be ignored.#throwing an exception makes the code that produced the error also handle it.#throwing exceptions is a more modern style.
An example of something student programs are <b>not</b> expected to handle is:#bad input#^hardware failures#divide-by-zero errors
Most large programs...#^will <b>always</b> contain some bugs.#can be fully de-bugged in a couple of days.#will likely be bug-free from the start.
